If your distribution’s package manager is listed on the right, you can install **ESClib** directly by running:
```sh
sudo YOUR-PACKAGE-MANAGER INSTALL-ARG ESClib
```

If your distro isn’t listed, see the [Universal Instalation](https://github.com/Sqydev/ESClib/edit/ReWrite/README.md#universal) section below.

#### Usage

Include the library header in your `.c` file:
```c
#include <esclib.h>
```

When compiling your code with gcc, add this flag:
```sh
-lesclib
```

### Universal 

#### Instalation

To install **ESClib** manually, run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sqydev/ESClib.git
```
Then simply copy the contents of the include/ and lib/YOUROSNAME/ directories into your project folder - for example, into your compiler’s global include/ directory to make the library available to all projects.

#### Usage

Include the library header in your `.c` file. Use the relative or absolute path if the header is not in a standard include directory:
```c
#include <path/to/esclib.h>
```

Compile your code by using your compiler's variant of flags bellow(flags bellow are for gcc):
```sh
-L/path/to/lib -lesclib
```
